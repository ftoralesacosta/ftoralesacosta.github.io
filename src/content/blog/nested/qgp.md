    We understand very little about the force that brought us the atomic bomb and nuclear energy. There's a very peculiar state of matter that we can create for a fraction of a second that's over 260,000 times hotter than the core of the sun that scientists can study to better understand this mysterious nuclear force.

Nuclear physicists have been studying heavy ion collisions for many years,
where the aim is to collide heavy nuclei, such as lead, at nearly the speed of
light. The center of these collisions produces a droplet of a novel state of
matter called quark-gluon plasma. When we think of matter, most people consider
three main states: solid, liquid, and gas. When matter (usually a gas) reaches
extremely high temperatures, the electrons and nuclei making up the atom
disassociate, producing another state of matter known as plasma.

The nuclei in that plasma, and all the matter we typically think of, are made
up of protons and neutrons. Through the efforts of nuclear and particle
physicists in the 20th century, it was discovered that the composition of
matter goes one level deeper.[^1] Protons and neutrons are themselves made up
of fundamental particles called quarks and gluons. Quarks and gluons interact
via the strong nuclear force, unlike photons and electrons that interact via
the electromagnetic force. One oddity of the strong nuclear force is that
quarks need to be closely confined together, which is why particles like
protons and neutrons that make up the nucleus of an atom are so stable. The
potential (function describing energy) of quarks is so great and prefers
confinement so strongly that if we were somehow able to tear two quarks apart
(e.g., a pair that make up a π meson), it would require us to use so much
energy that it would be energetically favorable to produce a quark-antiquark
pair that each bind to the original quarks in the system, creating two stable
particles.[^2] There are no bubble chambers, nor tracks, nor pictures of single
quarks and gluons. Period.

Breaking the Confinement Rule Now let’s build a crazy machine to break that
rule—sort of. Going back to states of matter, there is a lesser-known state of
matter, a plasma actually, that takes the idea of disassociation in a plasma
much, much further.

What if you take that plasma and keep heating and compressing it? Let’s ignore
the electrons for now and focus on the nuclei. How could we create the most
energy-dense, high-temperature, high-pressure system in the known universe? You
take a really beefy nucleus like gold or lead[^3]—just the nucleus, so it’s a
dense, positively charged ball—and accelerate it as close to the speed of light
as you can possibly manage. You do this with a bunch of nuclei at the same
time, speeding them up through several highly synchronized superconducting
magnets organized in a ring deep underground in Long Island, or, if you prefer,
France and Switzerland. You now have what we call a beam of nuclei, or ions.
Now repeat, but in the opposite direction around the ring.

That all might sound crazy, but that was the easy part. Now we want to cross
these unimaginably small beams (only a few nuclei wide) dead on, exactly into
each other, so that nuclei actually hit each other. That’s like shooting a bow
and arrow at a regular target on Earth from the sun—drunk, blindfolded, and
spun around a dozen times for good measure. A tremendous amount of work goes
into this, but long story short, engineers and physicists solved this problem
so well that our detectors have trouble keeping up with the frequency of the
resulting explosions.

What's amazing is we started with one of the densest objects we know of,
nuclei, and actually made them even denser; as we accelerate the nuclei close
to the speed of light, from our perspective they pancake, or 'Lorentz
contract,' before they ever collide. Once nuclei collide, the energy and
density are so high that the constituent protons and neutrons melt into the
quark-gluon plasma.

The Mysterious Strong Nuclear Force The reason physicists are so interested in
quark-gluon plasma is because the strong nuclear force is particularly
mysterious. The confinement mentioned previously is only one side of the coin
with the strong force. At larger distances, the strong force is unbelievably
strong (100 times stronger than electromagnetic forces and 1,000,000 times
stronger than the weak nuclear force), and it does not decrease at larger
distances. Think about that for a second. Almost anything you can think of
falls off the further away from it you are. Two magnets far apart are barely
felt. The further you are from a mass, like a planet, you feel weightless. The
strong force is instead like a focused beam of attraction that just doesn't
quit. Bizarre.

But then at smaller distances, when quarks and gluons are very close together,
the strong nuclear force taps out almost completely. The strongest force in the
Standard Model is extinguished, and the quarks and gluons inside stable
particles are swimming around freely. Bizarre.

Anyway, the math to describe this doesn't exist. We just can't really describe
these two phenomena cohesively. We've harnessed relativity and launched
satellites in stable orbit around the Earth so you can yell at your Uber driver
when he makes a wrong turn to pick you up. But we really can't describe what's
going on with the basic building blocks of matter.

Quark-gluon plasma is unique because, for a fraction of a second, we create a
primordial soup with such high energy and pressure that all the quarks and
gluons are free. Then, somehow, it transitions into a spray of stable particles
where all the quarks and gluons are confined. What better way to learn about
the behavior that eludes rigorous description than to study a state of matter
completely dictated by it? It's a fluid, a nearly perfect fluid, with the lowest
possible viscosity and entropy.[^4]

Why Should You Care? Okay, it's interesting for a few fringe scientists that
play with gold and lead or whatever.[^5] But why should anyone else care? Well,
you're still reading this, and the sunk-cost fallacy dictates that you have to
care about this now, else the past X minutes you spent reading this are wasted.
Checkmate.

But let's think about what we've been able to do with our current understanding
of the strong nuclear force, limited as it may be. It's actually not a very
long list:

1. Apocalypse-inducing bombs capable of instantly vaporizing entire cities and
poison the planet forever.[^6]
2. One of the safest, densest, most stable, easily the cleanest
sources of energy ever discovered that could usher humanity into a
post-energy-scarcity future.[^7]

There's a huge amount to be learned from quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in
heavy-ion collisions that can constrain models of the strong nuclear force. Is
QGP produced in smaller collisions, between a proton and a lead ion, or even
proton-proton collisions?[^8] How do we eke out important signals from the enormous
background of random particles produced in these crazy collisions?[^9] How exactly
does the soup of quarks and gluons combine into the final state particles we
see in our detectors?[^10] And why is it that so many disparate final-state
particles after the QGP has cooled continue to flow like a fluid, when there's
nowhere near enough time for them to reach any kind of equilibrium?[^11]
